# Penny-Doubling Simulation

This is a Python program that simulates the doubling of a penny every day for a specified number of days. The program takes the number of days as input and outputs the amount of money you would have each day, starting with a penny.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/penny-doubling-simulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd penny-doubling-simulation`
3. Run the program: `python penny-doubling-simulation.py`

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of days to simulate. You should enter an integer value for the number of days.

The program will then simulate the doubling of a penny every day for the specified number of days and output the amount of money you would have each day.

If the amount of money is less than 1 dollar, the program will print the amount in cents. If the amount of money is 1 dollar or more, the program will print the amount in dollars.

If the amount of money has decimals, the program will print the amount with two decimal places.

## Example Output

Here is an example of what the program's output might look like:

Enter the number of days to simulate: 10
On day 1, you have 1 cent
On day 2, you have 2 cents
On day 3, you have 4 cents
On day 4, you have 8 cents
On day 5, you have 16 cents
On day 6, you have 32 cents
On day 7, you have 64 cents
On day 8, you have 1.28 dollars
On day 9, you have 2.56 dollars
On day 10, you have 5.12 dollars
